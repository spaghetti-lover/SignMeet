 History will remember Joe Biden as an outstanding president who defended democracy at a moment of great danger. And I am proud to call him my president. The people who will decide this election are asking a very simple question. Who will fight for me? One thing is for certain. Donald Trump is not losing sleep over that question. I am feeling hopeful because this convention has always been pretty good to kids with funny names who believe in a country where anything is possible. The next president of the United States of America, Kamala Harris. Yes she can. Yes, we do.
